A Re-introduction to Magic: The Gathering or, How Do I Know Which Cards Are Standard?
=====================================================================================

If you've played [Magic: The Gathering][mtg] several years ago and only just recently wanted to start playing again, then the current ecosystem surrounding Magic might be a little daunting. There are about a thousand new cards released each year and it is near impossible to keep up. This post will attempt to help you get re-introduced to Magic.

Blocks and Sets
---------------
Each year, Wizards releases 4 sets which define the [Standard][standard] format. 3 of those sets are called "expansion sets", and those 3 sets together form a "Block". 
These blocks usually have a theme/story occuring on a single plane attached to them and their cards. The 4th set is called a "Core Set", which serve as an "introductory" set.

### Expansions ###
The most recent block at the time of writing, "[Scars of Mirrodin][som]" (SOM), features cards depicting Phyrexia's invasion of Mirrodin. Mirrodin is an artifact plane, so its sets have a lot of artifacts, much more than a usual set, to reflect that.
Each block will also introduce new mechanics. For SOM, it introduced *Metalcraft* and *Infect*. These mechanics are unique to the SOM block, and will not be featured in future blocks.

The first set of an expansion is released during Fall.

### Core Sets ###
Core sets are referred to as "introductory" sets because most of the cards are reprints of older cards and do not introduce any new mechanics. 
They do not have any themes/story, unlike the expansions. 

A new Core set is released during early Summer.

The Standard Format
-------------------
There are several official formats in Magic, but [Standard][standard] is usually considered the "default" format. 

To play standard, you need to have a deck of *no less than* 60 cards, using only cards which are legal in Standard, with no more than 4 copies of each card (excluding basic lands). You can have a sideboard of at most 15 cards, the 4-of rule still applied. 

Cards are considered legal for Standard when it is included in a set which is currently in "rotation". 

### Set Rotations ###
Sets rotate in and out every year when the first set of an expansion block is released. So, every Fall, when the first set of a new expansion is released, the oldest 4 sets rotate out and stop being Standard legal. This period, in my opinion, is the best time to re-introduce yourself to Magic, since during this time Standard will have the least number of cards legal and you get to "follow" how the new format develops. 

Here is a rough timeline of the current rotation:

    Before September 2010		September 2010						February 2011						May 2011										July 2011						September 2011
    																																					-> we are here <-
    Currently legal:			Scars of Mirrodin set is released	Mirrodin Besieged set is released	New Phyrexia set is released					Magic 2012 Core set released	Innistrad set will be released
    - Shards of Alara block		Scars of Mirrodin rotates in		Currently legal:					the last set of the Scars of Mirrodin block,	Currently legal:				Innistrad rotates in
    - Magic 2010 Core set		Shards of Alara block rotates out	- Zendikar block					completing the Scars of Mirrodin block			- Zendikar block				Zendikar block rotates out
    - Zendikar block			Magic 2010 rotates out				- Magic 2011 Core set				Currently legal:								- Magic 2011 Core set			Magic 2011 rotates out
    - Magic 2011 Core set		Currently legal:					- Scars of Mirrodin					- Zendikar block								- Scars of Mirrodin block		Currently legal:
    							- Zendikar block					- Mirrodin Besieged					- Magic 2011 Core set							- Magic 2012 Core set			- Scars of Mirrodin block
    							- Magic 2011 Core set													- Scars of Mirrodin block														- Magic 2012 Core set
    							- Scars of Mirrodin																																		- Innistrad
    
From the above timeline, the dates before September 2010 and between July - September 2011 have the most number of sets in rotation (a total of 9 sets!). 
On September 2010 & 2011 though, only 5 sets are legal. A few months from now, the Zendikar block and Magic 2011 Core set will rotate out. 

### Identifying Which Set A Card Belongs ###
Each card in Magic (except the really old ones from Alpha, Beta, etc.) has a symbol located at the right side just below the artwork. That symbol identifies which set it belongs to.

What's New
----------
Several things have changed in Magic through the years. Listed below is a list of the most common "what the f\*ck is this?!" moments for returning players.

### Planeswalkers ###
Planeswalkers are a new type of card introduced in the Lorwyn block (2007). Flavorwise, Planeswalker cards are "allies" you summon to help you win. 
They are like another player joining in the middle of the game and are usually very powerful. Creatures can attack them and can be targetted by some spells which can only target other players. 

Planeswalkers enter the battlefield with a default number of "loyalty" counters. These counters function as both the life and mana of a Planeswalker. 
They have specific abilities with loyalty costs. Some abilities remove loyalty, while others add loyalty. These abilities can only be activated as a sorcery, and only once each turn. 

When a Planeswalker takes damage, either from a creature attack or a spell, it uses that much loyalty counters.
When a Planeswalker's loyalty reaches 0, either from taking damage or using abilities, it dies and goes to the graveyard. 

### Power Creep ###

> Power Creep is a phenomenon present in any collectible game that uses both old elements and new ones. 
> The idea behind it is that the company has to sell their new products, but everything new they create 
> has to compete with previously existing pieces. To compensate for this, new cards end up becoming superior 
> to other cards to the point of becoming strictly superior.

Power creep, much more apparent on creatures, is affecting most new cards in Magic. 
When you first encounter a [5/5 Trampler with "Whenever a source deals damage to this creature, that source's controller sacrifices that many permanents. " and with a converted mana cost of 4][obliterator], you can't help but feel that things are not what they used to be.
Don't worry, you're not alone. You'll get used to it. Just remember, everything in Magic dies to something else.

### Rarities ###

There are 4 levels of rarity in Magic. Common, Uncommon, Rare and Mythic Rare. A card's power usually reflects its rarity (i.e. a mythic rares are usually very powerful). 

Rarity is determined by the color of a card's expansion symbol. A common has a flat black & white symbol. Uncommon has a silver shaded symbol. Rare has gold/yellow. Mythic Rares have an orange/dark gold color.

Summary
-------
This post ended up longer than intended, and there's still a lot more I might have missed/decided not to include/don't know much about to write (e.g. the stack).

To recap, here's a short summary. Magic cards are released in sets. Three sets of the same theme form a block (called an expansion). A core set is released every year.

Sets rotate in & out every Fall when a new expansion is released. 

Planeswalkers are a new card type which take some getting used to. 

Power creep is a noticeable change which also take some getting used to.

* * * *

tl;dr:

"What? I just wanted to know which cards are considered Standard legal. "

Since the current rotation includes the Zendikar block, M11, Scars of Mirrodin block and M12, any cards which has the symbol of those sets are Standard legal.
